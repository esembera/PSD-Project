# ReNewHouse

We want to model the service offered by a house renovation company to its clients. The house renovation company service relies on the services offered by a set of plumbers, electrician, constructors, painters, furniture providers and designers.\
Based on the requests of the client (the householder), contact them and select the best ones.
