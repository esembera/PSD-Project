# ReNewHouse

We want to model the service offered by a house renovation company to its clients. The house renovation company service relies on the services offered by a set of plumbers, electrician, constructors, painters, furniture providers and designers.\
Based on the requests of the client (the householder), contact them and select the best ones.

## Choreographed process

This is an elicopter view of the process managed by the house renovation company:

- Process starts with the request of the house holder
- The house renovation company contacts the plumber, electrician, constructor, painter, furniture provider or designer, depending on the house holder's request
- The house renovation company waits for the response of the contacted service provider
- The house renovation company chooses the best offer and sends it to the house holder
- The house holder accepts or rejects the offer
- If the offer is accepted, the house renovation company contacts the service provider and the service provider starts the work
- The process end when the work is finished or when the house holder rejects the offer
